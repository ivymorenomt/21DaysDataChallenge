### Day Two: math with Python
Life outside of the city sure is different. The costs of everyday things are different, too. Dot took a trip to the tiny grocer in the nearby town to stock up on essentials for the next few weeks. But the prices here sure are different than in the city!

Dot needs to start paying more attention to finances if theyâ€™re going to do well out here. Can you help them figure out how much their grocery haul is going to cost?


#### Numbers

There are two main numeric data types in Python, integers and float.

The integer data types refer to whole numbers, while float data types refer to any numeric value that isn't a whole, like a fraction or a decimal.

In Python as well as any other programming language, there are a variety of math operations you can use to do basic arithmetic.

In Python, lists are a type of variable that can be sequenced. Lists can contain many items that can be indexed by integers, with items being kept separate by the ','.

list = [] #lists are called using the square brackets

list_of_int = [1,2,3,4,5] #list of integers
list_of_string = ['string1','string2', 'string3'] #list of strings
list_of_anything = [1, 'string', 3.2] #list with an integer, string, and float.

Day Two is about calculating the percentage difference between city groceries vs country groceries. 
The formula is:

C = C1-C2 / C2 

where C1 is the sum of city groceries
C2 is the sum of country groceries over C2.
