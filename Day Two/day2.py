'''
Dot has a few lists you can use as reference: their grocery list, the prices they used to pay in the city, and the prices for the rural grocer.
**What is the price difference between groceries in the city vs. groceries in the country, as a percentage of country prices?**

**Note:** The index position for each item is consistent across all three lists.
